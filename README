This library is used to control DIYSandbox Arduino-based WiFi 
products on both Arduino and chipKIT Uno32 and chipKIT Max32 
(Max32 uses Serial1).  This version is experimental.

Current status:
Using serial output via Serial0 to identify where the code 
stops when using the Max32. Have not done any testing on the 
Arduino as yet.

chipKIT code works with the LED demo, but does occasionally 
lock up after re-programming. Haven't found cause, but 
disconnect USB and reconnect and seems to work reliably then. 

Hoping someone with the Arduino setup can test and advise.

Remember, it's still experimental!!!
