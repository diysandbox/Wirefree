Date        Changes
----------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Jul 05 2011 - Initial version of WebServer code.
            - Modifications to webpage and HTTP output need to be done in gs.cpp
            - This is an interim fix until the code that is compatible with the
              Ethernet library is fully working

Nov 07 2011 - Added WebServer & WebClient sketches

Jan 29 2012 - Added compatibility with chipKIT Uno32 and Max32 (Max32 using Serial1
              instead of Serial0). This version is experimental.

Feb 5 2012  - Added some debug code to Wirefree.cpp to attempt to see where the
			  project locks up. Also changes some errors in the #ifdef parts to
			  identify if it's a chipKIT Max32 or not. Seems to have solved the
			  issues being seen. Succesfull tests with the LED demo on Max32.
